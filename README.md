This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## IN PROGRESS

The project is not fully ready.

There are a couple of bugs, and probably a rework could help the structure and make the product more scalable. 

Some of the current issues:
- Editting is buggy (e.g. UI photo deletion)
- After submitting a form, the data doesn't update automatically, only after refresh
- Form is not responsive
- No loading animation 

Added functionalities:
- Light / Dark mode
- Connected to S3, uploads images there
- Data is stored in Vercel Postgres (which is sometimes slow, as after 5 min of not using, it shuts down its resources)
- Responsive grid layout / "More" popup window
