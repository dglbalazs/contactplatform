This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## IN PROGRESS

The project ~~is not fully ready~~ kinda ready :).

There are a couple of bugs, and probably a rework could help the structure and make the product more scalable. 

Some of the current issues:
- ~~Editting is buggy (e.g. UI photo deletion)~~ FIXED
- ~~After submitting a form, the data doesn't update automatically, only after refresh~~ FIXED
- ~~Form is not responsive~~ KINDA FIXED
- No loading animation 

Added functionalities:
- Light / Dark mode
- Connected to S3, uploads images there
- Data is stored in Vercel Postgres (which is sometimes slow, as after 5 min of not using, it shuts down its resources)
- Responsive grid layout / "More" popup window
- Pre-popuplates data in Edit mode
